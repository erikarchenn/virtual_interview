<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction
For our CS 366 final project, we developed an AI chatbot to understand the effects of gender presentation in these voice interfaces (VUI's) and how they impact participant performance in mock job interviews. To utilize the AI interviewer as a practice tool, you must click on the microphone icon in the interface to begin conversing, and clicking once more to finish up what you have to say. You must introduce yourself initially as "Alex," a gender-neutral persona to prevent any gender bias. 

## Running this Interface on your Device
To utilize this interface, you must download the code in this repository (works regardless of the device OS) and run the code on your IDE of choice (ex. VS Code).
You must download all three files: `app.py` , `requirements.txt` , and `utils.py` . All 3 are necessary to run the code successfully on your device.

## Installation
Below you will find instructions on how to fire up the virtual mock interview.
1. To preface, the male voice is named "onyx" where the female voice is named "nova," this is critical information if you choose to utilize this interface to practice interviewing.
   This can be changed in line 35 of `utils.py` as shown in this line:
   ```sh
   voice="nova",
   ```
